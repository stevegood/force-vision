# Force Vision
Visual recognition of X-Wing Miniatures cards, miniatures, and cardboards.

## What is this?
Force Vision aims to be a library that uses machine learning to visually
identify pilot and upgrade cards, ship miniatures, and cardboard peices.

## Why do this?
I like playing X-Wing Minatures when I get a chance but since my daughter
was born time is at a premium and as a result I am unable to play as often
as I would like. I often wish I had the ability to play solo against some
kind of AI but none exist. As such, I have decided to try my hand at
creating an AI that uses AR to interact with the game board. As part of that
AI, card and peice recognition is a must have.  This is my attempt to build that.

## What are you using to build this?
I am new to the realm of object detection and identification but I hear that
TensorFlow is the best tool (for now) to do this kind of work.  So, I'm attempting
to use that. It is entirely possible that I may change my mind later on down
the line as new requirements or implementations reveal themselves.

## Want to help?
Do the GitHub things with a fork and PR. I assume at this point we don't need
to go over the instructions for that...

## May the Force be with you
May the Force be with us all.
